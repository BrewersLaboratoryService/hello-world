# hello-world
First Stab
I am an old guy trying to learn new tricks.
I have made a couple of very basic arduino programs - and I have worked with LaTeX.  The only formal training I have had in programming was a class in COBOL back in 1984 (the only thing I remember is that COBOL stands for Common Oriented Business Language).
